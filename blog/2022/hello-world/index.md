hello world, about the blog
-----
Hello world! This is just a short blog post to say that I'm starting to make some blog posts.

If you poke around the site, you'll very quickly realise how unfinished most of it is - however I've now got a working setup that allows me to make and post blog posts, so I'm starting that now. (I'll talk about how I'm doing it in some of my later posts)

I've got some ideas in mind for what I'll be putting here, so hopefully I'll be able to get a few more of these out in the coming weeks!
