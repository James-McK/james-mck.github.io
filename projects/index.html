			<h1>Projects</h1>
			[WIP]
			<p>This is just the initial version of this page - I'm currently working on its layout, but I wanted to get the content finalised first. I'll also probably add individual pages for some of the more significant projects too.</p>

			<h3>Personal website</h3>
			<p>The website you're currently browsing! Created by me, and optimised to be as minimal as possible. Several of the main pages, like this one, were created by hand, with some (e.g. blog posts) being generated automatically from markdown using templates and a script I've written.</p>

				- Additional challenges, such as an extra tile being added every second<br />
				- Generally cleaner code
